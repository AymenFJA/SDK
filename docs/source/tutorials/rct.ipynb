    "RADICAL-Cybertools support the execution of ensemble applications at scale on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. Ensemble applications enable using diverse algorithms to coordinate the execution of up to $10^6$ tasks on all the processors (CPU/GPU) of an HPC machine. This type of applications are common in biophysical systems, climate science, seismology, and polar science domains. RADICAL-Cybertools address challenges of scale, diversity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive ensemble are a particularly interesting type of ensemble applications in which adaptivity is used to determine the behavior of the application at runtime. For example, many biomolecular sampling algorithms are formulated as adaptive: replica-exchange, Expanded Ensemble, etc. Introducing adaptivity, improved simulation efficiency of up to a factor three but implementing adaptive ensemble applications is challenging due to the complexity of the required algorithms."

    "RADICAL-Cybertools offers [RADICAL-EnsembleToolkit (EnTK)](https://radicalentk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a workflow engine specifically designed to support the execution of (adaptive) ensemble applications at scale on HPC platforms. EnTK allows users to separate adaptive logic and simulation/analysis code, while abstracting away from the users issues of resource management and resource management and runtime execution coordination. \n",

    "EnTK exposes a simple application programming interface (API), implemented in Python and with two (Pythonic) collections of objects and three classes:\n",

    "* Sequence/List: contains objects that have a linear order, i.e. object 'i' depends on object 'i-1'\n",
    "* Task: description of executing kernel\n",
    "* Stage: set of Tasks, i.e. all tasks of a stage may execute concurrently\n",
    "* Pipeline: sequence of Stages, i.e., Stage 2 may only commence after Stage 1 completes\n",

    "The two pipelines execute concurrently and, as per EnTK API definitions, each stage inside each pipeline executes sequentially. Importantly, when a stage contains **multiple** tasks, all those tasks can execute concurrently, assuming that enough resources are available. Given a set of resources, EnTK always executes the ensemble application with the highest possible degree of concurrency but, when not enough resources are available, the tasks of a stage may be executed sequentially. All this is transparent to the user that is left free to focus on the ensemble algorithm without having to deal with parallelism and resource management."
