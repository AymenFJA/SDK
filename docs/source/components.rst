Components
==========

The SDK Workflow Systems in Brief:

*  `Parsl <https://parsl-project.org>`_. Pure Python library for describing and managing parallel computation on one to many nodes.  It contains abstractions to support various parallel and distributed workloads: from bag-of-tasks to dataflow, short to long duration tasks, single core through to multi-node.
*  `Flux <http://flux-framework.org>`_. Workload management system (Ã  la Slurm, PBS, LSF), with single-user and multi-user (a.k.a. system instance) modes.
*  `RADICAL-Cybertools <https://radical-cybertools.github.io>`_. An abstractions-based suite of middleware building blocks that are architected for scalable, interoperable and sustainable approaches to support science on a range of high-performance and distributed computing systems.
* `Swift/T <http://swift-lang.org/Swift-T>`_. Swift/T is an MPI-based workflow language and runtime system.  It runs in a one big job model, with internal automatic task parallelization and data movement, enhanced by workflow-level compiler optimizations.
